# erascrape
A little web scraper to get the start and end dates for Japanese eras.

A simple way to get a list of up to date information on Japanese era names, 
start dates, and end dates to use in Python programs.

Just scrapes houshinji.org for the era name, start date, and end date. It 
cleans up the whitespace and returns the information as a list. What you 
choose to do with it after that is up to you.

There are database helper scripts for SQLite if you so choose to go that route.

# Installation
Run the setup script.
